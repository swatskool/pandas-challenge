# <cnter> pandas-challenge
This project is about a Virtual gaming and player purchasing trends in the fictional game of 'Heros of PyMoli'
Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. 
We have analysed the purchase data of the players using pandas.

The data points have been munged to bring out the following information:
## ->Analysis of Purchasing trends of all the players
## ->Analysis of Purchasing trends of players based on Gender
## ->Analysis of Purchasing trends of players based on Age
## ->Item wise purchase Analysis
## ->Top spenders and most profitable Items


## After detailed analysis following trends can be highlighted: 
1. Players of the age group 20-24 are the biggest contributors in the revenue and are making the maximum number of transcations(purchases)
2. Number of Male players are nearly 6 times more than the female players of the game
3. Item 'Final Critic' (Item ID 92) is the most popular purchase item which is bought over a dozen times during the given period and has contributed $59.99 to the total revenue.

## Limitations
The data presents the following limitations:
-> No clear timelines mentioned. While this data may be hypothetical , we have no idea about how fresh/latest the data is as the gaming world is constantly changing and there is high possibility that the gender based and age based trends are constantly changing.
-> The data doesnot mention about the duration of the observation. This data could be the revenue generated over a  month or a week or a year and accordingly the perspective towards the trends would change.
